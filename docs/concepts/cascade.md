# The engine and the cascade

`Engine` owns the decision cascade, the reasoning model and the tracer.

```python
from fastbrain import Engine, JSONLSink, Tracer
from fastbrain.llm import TransformersLLM
from fastbrain.providers import GLiNER, Laya, LLMDecider, Rules

llm = TransformersLLM("Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B")
engine = Engine(
    providers=[rules, GLiNER(), Laya(), LLMDecider(llm)],   # cheapest first
    llm=llm,                                                # for generate()
    threshold=0.8,
    thresholds={"urgency": 0.2},
    tracer=Tracer([JSONLSink(".fastbrain/traces")]),
)
```

## How a batch moves through the cascade

For `engine.decide_many(state, questions)`:

1. Every question starts open.
2. For each provider, in order:
    - Select the open questions the provider supports (by kind, by its own
      `supports()` logic, and by each question's `providers` allowlist).
      Skip the provider if there are none.
    - Call it once with all of them.
    - For each answer, compute the normalized confidence and compare it with
      the question's threshold. Accepted answers close their question. The
      rest stay open, and the best one seen so far is remembered.
3. Questions still open after the last provider come back `uncertain` with
   their best answer, or `abstained` if no provider answered.

Each provider call is an `attempt` span inside the batch's `decide` span, so
the trace shows exactly which questions each provider saw and which it
settled.

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning | What `decision.value` holds |
|---|---|---|
| `accepted` | An answer met its threshold, or came from an uncalibrated provider the engine trusts | The answer |
| `uncertain` | Every provider answered below threshold | The most confident answer seen |
| `abstained` | No provider produced an answer | `None` |

`decision.accepted` and `decision.is_(value)` make routing code safe by
default: an uncertain answer never matches.

## Escalation context

When a question escalates, the next provider only receives the questions that
are still open. For small models that is fine; for an LLM it can change the
answer. On the support benchmark, a request like "I want a human to confirm
it, not an automated reply" was classified correctly as a request for a person
when an LLM saw the whole triage batch, but flagged as a prompt injection when
the LLM was asked about injection alone, after the rules had already settled
the human request. Asked in isolation on the calibration set, Gemini 2.5 Flash
Lite called 5 of 10 such messages injections.

So the engine tells providers that accept it (the LLM decider does) which
questions of the same batch are already settled, and how:

```text
Already established by other checks:
- "wants_human" (Does the customer explicitly ask to talk to a human ...?): yes
```

On the calibration set this removed those false positives (3 to 0 in the
real cascade) without changing missed injections or the number of LLM calls.
It costs one short line per settled question. Turn it off with
`Engine(escalation_context=False)`; custom providers opt in by setting
`accepts_context = True` and accepting a `context` keyword in `answer`.

## Escalations

`decision.escalated` is true when an earlier provider answered below threshold
(or raised an error) and the next provider was asked. A provider that abstains,
such as a rule that does not match, passes the question on without counting as
an escalation: that is the cascade working as intended, at no cost.

## Which providers answer what

| Provider | Choice | Score | YesNo | Extract | Plane | Calibrated |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|
| `Rules` | yes | yes | yes | yes | rule | yes (confidence 1) |
| `GLiNER` | yes | | | yes | model | yes |
| `Laya` | yes | yes | yes | | model | yes |
| `SystemOne` (Jev, Kev, OpenJev) | yes | yes | yes | | model | yes |
| `LLMDecider` | yes | yes | yes | yes | llm | no |

A rules provider only claims the questions it has rules for.

## Errors

A provider that raises is recorded as a failed attempt (the span carries the
error) and the cascade continues with the next provider. Set
`Engine(on_error="raise")` to propagate instead, which is useful in tests.

## Restricting a question to specific providers

```python
APPROVE = YesNo("Should this refund be approved?", name="approve", providers=("rules", "jev"))
```

Use an allowlist when calibration shows a provider cannot answer a question
well. It is cheaper than letting the provider try and escalate every time.

## Latency accounting

`decision.latency_ms` is the time spent on that question across all of its
attempts. When several questions share a provider call, each of them is
charged the full call time, since each waited for it. Run-level numbers in
`TraceSummary` add up span durations and do not double count.

## Async

`adecide`, `adecide_many` and `agenerate` run the synchronous methods in a
worker thread with `asyncio.to_thread`, so an async web service can await
them without blocking its event loop. Tracing context carries across the
thread boundary.
