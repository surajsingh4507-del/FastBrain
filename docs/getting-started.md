# Getting started

## Install

FastBrain needs Python 3.10 or newer. The core package is small and pulls in
no model libraries; decision models and LLM backends are extras.

```bash
pip install fastbrain                          # core: rules, tracing, the HTTP System One provider
pip install "fastbrain[local]"                 # GLiNER, Laya and a local LLM (needs torch)
pip install "fastbrain[anthropic]"             # Claude as the reasoning plane
pip install "fastbrain[openai]"                # OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM and compatible servers
pip install "fastbrain[all]"                   # everything, including OpenTelemetry and benchmarks
```

For local models on a GPU, install PyTorch first; the
[installation guide](guides/installation.md) has the command for each
platform and explains every extra.

With conda, `environment.yml` creates an environment with everything and the
right PyTorch build for recent NVIDIA GPUs:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fastbrain
fastbrain doctor
```

## Your first decision

```python
from fastbrain import Choice, Engine
from fastbrain.providers import GLiNER

engine = Engine([GLiNER()])

intent = engine.decide(
    "I was charged twice for order #4471, please refund one of them.",
    Choice(
        "What does the customer want?",
        name="intent",
        options={
            "refund": "wants money back",
            "order_status": "asks where an order is",
            "other": "anything else",
        },
    ),
)

print(intent.value)        # refund
print(intent.confidence)   # 0.99
print(intent.provider)     # gliner
print(intent.latency_ms)   # about 16 on a laptop GPU
```

## A cascade

Add rules in front and an LLM behind. Rules answer the obvious cases for free,
the small model answers most of the rest, and the LLM only sees what the small
model is unsure about.

```python
from fastbrain import Choice, Engine, Extract, YesNo
from fastbrain.llm import TransformersLLM
from fastbrain.providers import GLiNER, Laya, LLMDecider, Rules

rules = Rules()
rules.match("wants_human", r"\b(real person|a human|operator)\b", True, field="message")
rules.extract("order", field="message", order_id=r"#\s?(\d{4,5})\b")

llm = TransformersLLM("Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B")
engine = Engine([rules, GLiNER(), Laya(), LLMDecider(llm)], llm=llm, threshold=0.8)

decisions = engine.decide_many(
    {"message": "Charged twice for #4471. Refund it or I'm cancelling."},
    [
        Choice("What does the customer want?", name="intent", options=["refund", "order_status", "other"]),
        YesNo("Is the customer asking for a person?", name="wants_human"),
        Extract(name="order", fields={"order_id": "the order number"}),
    ],
)
for name, d in decisions.items():
    print(name, d.value, d.status.value, d.provider, [a.provider for a in d.attempts])
```

## Generation

```python
reply = engine.generate(
    "Write two sentences confirming the refund of $49 for order 4471.",
    system="You are a concise support agent.",
    max_tokens=120,
)
print(reply.text, reply.usage)
```

## Traces

```python
from fastbrain import JSONLSink, Tracer

engine = Engine([rules, GLiNER()], tracer=Tracer([JSONLSink(".fastbrain/traces")]))

with engine.run("ticket", ticket_id="T-1", mode="hybrid") as run:
    engine.decide(ticket, INTENT)
print(run.summary())
```

```bash
fastbrain trace ls
fastbrain trace view         # opens the HTML viewer
```

## Try the demo agent

The package ships a complete support agent with a mock store and 53 labeled
tickets:

```bash
fastbrain demo --ticket T-016
fastbrain demo --ticket T-001 --mode hybrid --mode llm      # compare two decision planes
fastbrain demo --message "Where is order 2290?" --customer C-1007
fastbrain bench support                                      # every ticket, every mode
```

Add `--llm openrouter:qwen/qwen3.7-flash --reasoning off` (with
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`), or `--llm anthropic`, `--llm ollama:qwen3:8b`
or `--llm openai:<model>`, to use a different reasoning model.
