"""Reproduce the support demo's calibrated thresholds.

Runs Laya and GLiNER on the labeled calibration set that ships with the demo
(written separately from the benchmark tickets) and prints, for each
question and provider, the lowest threshold whose accepted answers meet the
accuracy target. The targets follow the policy stated in
``fastbrain/demo/support/questions.py``: 100 percent for the security
question, 95 percent for routing questions.
