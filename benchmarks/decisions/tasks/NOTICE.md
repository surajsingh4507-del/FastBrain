# Sources and licenses of the task files

The files in this directory are samples of public datasets, redistributed under
their licenses. Each was changed in the same ways: rows were sampled with a fixed
seed, labels were renamed to readable text (underscores become spaces), and
records were reformatted as JSON Lines with an `id`, a `state`, a `label` and a
`source` pointing back to the original row. Task-specific changes are listed
below. The FastBrain license does not apply to these files; each keeps its own.

- Citation: jackhhao/jailbreak-classification on Hugging Face
- Changes: The whole test split less one repeated prompt (399 rows, 140 jailbreaks); calibration rows from the train split.

## civil_comments

- Citation: Borkan et al., Nuanced Metrics for Measuring Unintended Bias with Real Data for Text Classification, 2019 (Jigsaw)
- Changes: Toxic means a toxicity score of 0.5 or more. Sampled half toxic and half not. Contains offensive language.

## helpsteer2

- Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 (revision `990b2711a36180dd19d9c94b8627844866f8982a`)

- Citation: Wang et al., HelpSteer2: Open-source dataset for training top-performing reward models, 2024 (NVIDIA)
- Changes: Human helpfulness ratings 0 to 4 mapped to five levels, sampled evenly per level. Test rows from the validation split, calibration rows from the train split. Human ratings are noisy, so mean absolute error and within-one accuracy are reported next to exact accuracy.

## wnut17

- Changes: Rows with at most one entity of each type; four in five rows mention at least one entity. Tokens are joined with spaces, as in the source.

Civil Comments contains offensive language, and the jailbreak prompts try to
make assistants misbehave. Both are included because detecting them is the task.
