# Support benchmark

- FastBrain 0.1.0, run 2026-09-25T06:21:34Z
- Reasoning model: `openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- Engine threshold: 0.8
- Reference price for cost estimates: `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5`
- Environment: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU, Python 3.12.14, torch 2.14.0+cu130
- Tickets: 53
- Billed cost is what the provider reported for each call (OpenRouter does). Reference cost prices the same LLM tokens at the reference model's published rates, so runs on different models and local runs can be compared; tokenizers differ, so compare it by ratio.
