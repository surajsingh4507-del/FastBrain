"""Confidence normalization.

Providers disagree about what "confidence" means. Measured on the same input,
Laya reports ``1 - normalized entropy`` for choices and ``max(p, 1 - p)`` for
yes/no questions, while TypeSafe documents ``(k * p_max - 1) / (k - 1)``. A
threshold of 0.8 would therefore mean something different depending on which
backend answered.

FastBrain computes one confidence from each provider's probability
distribution and applies thresholds to that number only. The provider's own
fields are kept untouched in ``Decision.raw``.

The formula is the normalized maximum probability, the same one TypeSafe
documents for Jev::

    confidence = (k * p_max - 1) / (k - 1)

It is 0 for a uniform distribution over ``k`` outcomes and 1 when all mass sits
on one outcome. For a yes/no question (``k = 2``) it reduces to
``2 * max(p, 1 - p) - 1``, so a threshold of 0.8 requires ``p >= 0.9``.
