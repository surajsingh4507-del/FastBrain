class Engine:
    """Answers typed questions with the cheapest provider that is confident enough.

    Providers are tried in the order given. Each provider receives, in one
    call, every still-open question it supports. An answer whose normalized
    confidence meets the question's threshold is accepted; the rest move on to
    the next provider. When every provider has been tried, questions that are
    still open come back ``uncertain`` with the best answer seen, or
    ``abstained`` if nobody answered.

    Args:
        providers: The decision cascade, cheapest first. A typical order is
            rules, then small local models, then a hosted decision model,
            then an LLM.
        llm: The reasoning plane, used by :meth:`generate`.
        threshold: Default minimum confidence to accept an answer.
        thresholds: Overrides keyed by question name, or by
            ``"<question>@<provider>"`` for a threshold that applies to one
            provider only (providers calibrate differently, so the same
            question often needs a different bar per model). Resolution
            order: ``question@provider``, then ``Question(threshold=...)``,
            then ``thresholds[question]``, then ``threshold``.
        trust_uncalibrated: Accept answers from providers without calibrated
            probabilities (a prompted LLM) as final. Set it to ``False`` to
            have such answers come back ``uncertain`` instead.
        tracer: Where spans go. Defaults to a tracer with no sinks.
        prices: Price table for cost estimates. Defaults to the bundled table,
            or ``$FASTBRAIN_PRICING`` when set.
        on_error: ``continue`` logs a failing provider and moves down the
            cascade; ``raise`` propagates the exception.
        escalation_context: Tell providers that accept it (the LLM decider)
            which questions of the same batch are already settled, and how.
            An escalated question otherwise reaches the LLM stripped of its
            siblings, and on the support benchmark that changed answers: asked
            alone whether a request for a human is an injection, one model
            said yes to 5 of 10 such messages. The cost is one short line per
            settled question.
        deadline_ms: Time budget for one ``decide`` or ``decide_many`` call.
            It is checked before each provider is asked: once it has passed,
            the remaining providers are skipped and open questions come back
            ``uncertain`` with the best answer so far. A provider call that
            is already running is not interrupted, so give hosted clients
            their own timeout.
        spend_limit: A :class:`~fastbrain.SpendLimit` shared by every call on
            this engine. Once it is used up, paid providers are skipped and
            :meth:`generate` raises :class:`~fastbrain.SpendLimitError`;
            rules and local models keep answering. ``run(max_cost_usd=...)``
            adds a cap for one run.

    Example:
        >>> engine = Engine([Rules(), GLiNER(), Laya(), LLMDecider(llm)], llm=llm)
        >>> intent = engine.decide(ticket, Choice("What does the customer want?", options=[...]))
