"""Shadow mode: measure what FastBrain would decide, and save, before it decides anything.

A :class:`Shadow` runs a candidate engine on the inputs an existing system
already handles, logs both answers, and changes nothing the existing system
returns. :func:`build_report` (``fastbrain shadow report``) turns the log into
agreement with confidence intervals, projected savings and a verdict per
question; :func:`export_labels` (``fastbrain shadow export``) writes the
disagreements as rows to label and calibrate on.
