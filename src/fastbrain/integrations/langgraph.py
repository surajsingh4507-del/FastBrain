"""FastBrain inside LangGraph: route edges and fill state with typed decisions.

Two pieces cover most graphs:

* :func:`router` returns a function for ``add_conditional_edges``. It decides
  one question on the latest user message and returns the next node. An
  uncertain decision goes to ``default``, usually the LLM agent node you
  already have.
* :func:`decision_node` returns a node that answers several questions in one
  batch and writes plain results into the state, where later nodes and
  edges read them.

Tool calls can be checked before they run with :func:`fastbrain.integrations.gate`
on the tool function.

Example:
    >>> intent = router(engine, INTENT, {"order_status": "tracking"}, default="agent")
    >>> builder.add_conditional_edges(START, intent, intent.destinations)
