"""FastBrain inside the OpenAI Agents SDK: guardrails and routing without extra LLM calls.

* :func:`input_guardrail` checks the user's input before the agent runs, and
  trips when the decision is accepted with the tripping answer, so a
  prompt-injection or off-topic check costs a rule or a small model instead
  of a second LLM call, and a tripped check stops the run before the agent's
  own model call.
* :func:`tool_input_guardrail` checks a tool call's arguments before the
  tool runs and rejects it with a message the model can read.
* :func:`route_agent` picks the specialist agent for a request, which
  replaces a triage agent whose only job is to hand off.

Needs ``pip install "fastbrain[openai-agents]"``.
