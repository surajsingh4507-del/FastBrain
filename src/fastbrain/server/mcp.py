"""Expose an engine's questions as MCP tools.

Each registered question becomes one tool, ``decide_<question>``, that takes
the text to decide on and returns the decision. An MCP client such as an IDE
assistant or a desktop agent can then make routine decisions for the price of
a rule or a small model, and see how confident the answer is.

Works with the MCP Python SDK 1.x (``FastMCP``) and 2.x (``MCPServer``).
