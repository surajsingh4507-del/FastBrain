"""A LangGraph support graph where decisions pick the path and gate the tools.

The graph you would build anyway, with two changes: a FastBrain node answers
the triage questions, and a FastBrain router picks the next node. Order
lookups and plain refunds never reach the LLM; everything uncertain goes to
the LLM agent node exactly as before. A policy gate checks each refund before
it runs. Nothing downloads and no API is called:

    pip install "fastbrain[langgraph]"
