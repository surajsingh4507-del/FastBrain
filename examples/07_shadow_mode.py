"""Shadow mode: measure what FastBrain would save before it decides anything.

An existing classifier keeps answering. A FastBrain engine (rules first, the
same LLM for the rest) runs next to it on every call and logs both answers.
The report then shows how often they agree and what each costs. Nothing
downloads and no API is called:

    pip install fastbrain
    python examples/07_shadow_mode.py
    fastbrain shadow report .fastbrain/shadow/intent.jsonl --min-calls 20
    fastbrain shadow export .fastbrain/shadow/intent.jsonl --out to_label.jsonl

The LLM is a scripted stand-in and the prices are illustrative, so the
numbers show how the report reads, not what your traffic will do. Both sides
use the same LLM, the same price table and prompts of similar length, so the
saving comes only from the tickets the rules settle.
